# The colour-order smoothSolver on the ENERGY field and the turbulence pair (FP-1, the default since
# 2026-09-12) against real OpenFOAM -- the scalar counterpart of tests/u_colour_gs_vs_openfoam.sh.
#
# Where a case names `smoothSolver` with a GaussSeidel-family smoother on e/h, k, epsilon or omega, the
# rhoSimpleFoam mirror's CUDA arm now sweeps those systems in COLOUR order through the momentum engine
# with one component (deviceColourGaussSeidelFused, nComp 1; tests/test_colour_gs_fused arm (m)) under
# smoothSolver::solve's stop rule, where OpenFOAM sweeps in index order. Gauss-Seidel is order-dependent:
# the two leave different iterates after n sweeps and converge to the same linear solution. That is what
# this gate holds the change to: EXACT where the linear solves are converged, DIFFERENT where they are
# not, and ANNOUNCED per field either way. Before FP-1 those entries ran OpenFOAM's own order on one CPU
# thread (the host smoother), which is what the REF arm still runs.
#
#   FIXTURE     validation/rhoKE (3,200 cells, kEpsilon, 2D), blockMesh at staging, every linear solver
#               at 1e-14 / relTol 0, 5 iterations. The energy and the pair get smoothSolver entries in
#               BOTH codes -- symGaussSeidel on "(h|e)", GaussSeidel on "(k|epsilon)", so both of
#               OpenFOAM's smoothers are exercised -- with the relTol/maxIter each arm names below. U stays
#               on the fixture's PBiCGStab/DILU entry and is pinned to OpenFOAM's own solver
#               (BRAE_U_SOLVER=ofOrder) in EVERY brae arm, so the momentum contributes no order effect and
#               BRAE_GS_ORDER alone selects what this gate measures.
#   ARM EXACT   relTol 0, maxIter 5000, BRAE_GS_ORDER=colour: every scalar solve converges to roundoff in
#               both codes, so U, p, T, k and epsilon at 5 must agree within BOUND (rel L2).
#   ARM REF     the same case under BRAE_GS_ORDER=ofOrder (OpenFOAM's own index-order sweep): must also
#               pass BOUND, so the bound is one this fixture meets and EXACT's pass is not a loose bound.
#   ARM SAID    EXACT carries the colour-order notice for e (or h), k and epsilon and the start-up line;
#               REF carries none of them and announces the smoothSolver path it took instead.
#   ARM DEFAULT the same case with NEITHER variable set (BRAE_U_SOLVER unset too): the colour notices
#               must be present, which proves the default; its fields are compared at the momentum
#               gate's DEF bound since U runs colour order there as well.
#   CONTROL     relTol 0.1 on the three scalar entries in BOTH codes: the two orders stop at different
#               iterates, so the fields at 5 must differ by MORE than BOUND. This proves the comparison
#               can see a solver difference, and documents the approximation the notices announce.
#   FAIL-PROOF  colour order with maxIter 1 on the scalars in brae ONLY (OpenFOAM keeps 5000): one colour
#               sweep per outer iteration against a converged solve must miss BOUND.
#   BOUND       1e-9, the momentum gate's bound on this fixture; every arm prints its numbers.
